        <p> The world is ninth-biggest country is the most economically advanced of <br>
            the stans, thanks to its abundant reserves of oil and most other valuable <br>
            minerals. That money has transformed the capital Nur-Sultan, on the windswept <br>
            northern steppe, into a 21st-century showpiece with a profusion of bold futuristic <br>
            architecture. Travelers will find some fantastic restaurants and accommodation amongst <br>
            the leafy avenues of Almaty too; its biggest city also boasts the chic ALZhiR Museum-Memorial <br>
            Complex, glossy shopping centres and hedonistic nightlife. But it's beyond the cities that you'll <br>
            find the greatest travel adventures, whether hiking in the high mountains and green valleys of the <br>
            Tian Shan, searching for wildlife on the lake-dotted steppe, enjoying homespun hospitality in village <br>
            guesthouses, or jolting across the western deserts to remote underground mosques.</p>
